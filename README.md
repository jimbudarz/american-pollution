# american-pollution
An interactive Shiny App to visualize pollution measurements across the U.S. 

## Questions worth asking:

Are our current laws keeping us safe from harmful pollution? (For splitting data into danger vs safe zone: What are high vs. safe levels? Asthma etc. https://www.epa.gov/criteria-air-pollutants/naaqs-table)

- Which cities and which areas of the country are most polluted? The least? How does city population affect pollution levels?
**(Map controlled by slider selecting year)**

- How do different pollutants vary across the country?
**(Map toggle for each pollutant)**

- How does city a compare to city b?
**(Box or violin plots for up to 5 selectable cities, plus Two-Sample T Tests to indicate whether cities are significantly different)**

- How does the pollution change over the long term?
**(Time series by selection of city)**

- How does the pollution change over the short term?
**(Time series by selection of city)**

- If possible: Are there any remarkable events?
**(Time-series inflection points)**

- How do the different pollutants relate to one another?
**(Correlation plot for all 4 different pollutants)**

## Notes on project scoring:

### Analysis

Provides clear purpose and subject: Who is the target audience? What are the questions you are trying to answer from the dataset?
Pertinent examples, graphs, and/or statistics; supports conclusions/ ideas with evidence.
There is a conclusion summarizing the presentation.

### Code
Project folder is well structured using gitignore.
Show the audience the workflow of the project.
Code quality: Effective naming (variables, functions, etc) Readability and consistency (comments, structure and layout, etc.) Efficiency (use functions efficiently, algorithms, etc.)

### Presentation
Speaker maintains good eye contact with the audience and is appropriately animated (e.g., gestures, moving around, etc.)
Speaker uses a clear, audible voice. Delivery is poised, controlled, and smooth.
Length of presentation is within the assigned time limits.
Easy to follow and informative.
